# Tutorial
**Part1)** Using Visual Studio Code

1) Download Visual Studio Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2) Once VSC is open, you can create a new profile. (Profiles allow you to organize your workspace and extensions easier.
   You can use the default profile, but keeping an organized workspace is good practice.)
3) Create a new file, once created it will ask you to choose which language you will program in.
4) Program/Prepare your website
5) Hit Ctrl+Shift+G then hit G again to open the Source Control in VSC
6) In the source control window (Ctrl+Shift+G), click the ellipsis (...)
8) Select the Push dropdown menu
9) Now get the URL for your GitHub repository
10) In VSC you'll see a prompt, click "Add Remote"
11) At the top of the screen, paste your GitHub repository link
12) Then click "Publish Branch"
13) Verify changes on GitHub


**Part2)** Glossary

**Branch** - an independent version of the main code; essentially a copy you can work on without making permanent changes to the main code

**Clone** - copy of an existing remote repository to the current local directory

**Commit** - saves a snapshot of a given branch; serve as a history of all branches in a repository

**Fetch** - retrieves changes(commits,files,etc.) from another repository but does not integrate them

**GIT** - version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history 

**Github** - website that lets developers store, track, and collaborate on software projects

**Merge** - allows a user to apply all changes from one branch to another

**Merge Conflict** - occurs when 2 developers try to merge to the same part of a file at the same time; Git isn't sure which version of the code to keep

**Push** - process of moving code from one repository to another; often used to move code from a local machine to GitHub

**Pull** - retrieves and integrates changes from another repository or branch; often used to get code from GitHub to a local machine

**Remote** - shared repository that allows team members to exchange changes; often hosted on a service like GitHub

**Repository** - central location where a projects code, files, and history are stored; allows you to collaborate with others and manage different versions of your project
